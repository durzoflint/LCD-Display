# LCD-Display
Stimulate the code of a LCD Display in Java. I found this online and solved it.

Input:
      The input ﬁle contains several lines, one for each number to be displayed. Each line contains integers s and n, where n is the number to be displayed (0≤ n ≤99,999,999) and s is the size in which it shall be displayed(1≤ s ≤10).The input will be terminated by a line containing two zeros, which should not be processed.
      
Output:
      Print the numbers speciﬁed in the input ﬁle in an LCD display-style using s “-” signs for the horizontal segments and s “|” signs for the vertical ones. Each digit occupies exactly s +2 columns and 2s +3 rows. Be sure to ﬁll all the white space occupied by the digits with blanks, including the last digit. There must be exactly one column of blanks between two digits. Output a blank line after each number.
